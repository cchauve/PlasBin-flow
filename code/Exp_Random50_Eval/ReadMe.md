# Experiment to Test Independence of Results from E. coli Data

This experiment aims to determine whether the results in `(https://github.com/cchauve/PlasBin-flow/tree/Classification/code/Exp)`directory are independent of using *E. coli* data. 

The methodology described in the [Exp/ReadMe.md](https://github.com/cchauve/PlasBin-flow/blob/Classification/code/Exp/ReadMe.md) file was repeated, substituting *E. coli* data with 50 randomly selected samples.
