# Experiment Description

This experiment is designed to assess the impact of using contigs predicted as plasmid by **Platon** as seed contigs in **PlasBinFlow**, instead of using the default seeds generated by the **PlasBin** code.

## Requirements for Running PlasBinFlow

### Input File
A CSV file containing rows with information for each sample. Each row must include:
- **Sample ID**
- **GFA file path**
- **GC content file path**
- **GD score file path**
- **Seeds file path**

### Script to Execute
- `plasbin_flow.py`:This script runs one sample at a time.paths for each sample must be extracted using an additional script.
#### Command Example
```bash
python plasbin_flow.py \
       -ag ${GFA} \
       -gc ${GC} \
       -score ${GD} \
       -out_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
       -out_file ${OUT_FILE} \
       -log_file ${LOG_FILE} \
       -seeds ${SEEDS}
```
## Requirements for Running the Evaluation

The input file address should be manually set in `eval.py`. This file should contain:
- **Sample name**
- **GFA path**
- **Ground Truth path**
- **PlasBinFlow Prediction output path**
- **Seeds file path**

### Script for Evaluation
- `eval.py`

## Results

Detailed statistics generated by `eval.py` can be found in **granular_statistics.csv**. 

Key findings:
- **Recall:** Relatively high
  - Unweighted: **0.78**
  - Weighted: **0.92**
- **Precision:**
  - Unweighted: **0.51**
  - Weighted: **0.30**

While the results show a relatively high recall, both unweighted and weighted precisions are very low. Further analysis is needed to explain the cause of the low precision.
